# WK5-Calendar

Application that allows you to schedule workday events and store them locally, so that you can come back to them.

I managed to get the skeleton down, though trying to figure out why my colors weren't working exactly how I wanted them to was a bit of a doozy. 
Local storage also had me a bit confused. I still need to dedicate a lot of time to really understanding JavaScript and by extension JQuery.
